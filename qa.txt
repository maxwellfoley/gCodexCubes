1. What are the differences between the Scene* and shared_ptr<scene> data types in C++?

shared_ptr gets deleted automatically (garbage collected) when not in use, and with * you have to delete it in the code. 

2. How does G3D know where the scene files are located?


3. Why should you to put your initialization code into App::onInit instead of constructor App::App? (Tip: There are many reasons. Try throwing an exception from each, and consider the implications of throwing an exception from a class's constructor.)


4. What is the call chain that invokes App::onGraphics3D?


5. Where is the file cube.obj stored on the file system? How did the Scene parser know to load it from there?


6.You can create a material in a scene file from a Color3. There are many more ways to construct a G3D material, however. One of these takes separate lambertian, glossy, emissive, and transmissive values. Speculate on why a homogeneous material (i.e., one without a pattern or image) would require four separate “colors” in its specification.
